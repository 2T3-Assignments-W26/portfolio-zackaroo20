About PowerShell

**PowerShell** is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to help users automate tasks, manage systems, and perform administrative tasks efficiently. Built on the .NET framework, **PowerShell** is both a **_command-line tool_** and a **_scripting environment_**, making it a versatile tool for programmers and system administrators.

Quote: "PowerShell is great because we had a series of rockstar engineers add their awesomeness to the project." ( from the interview with Jeffrey Snover, PowerShell Inventor)
