About PowerShell

**PowerShell** is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to help users automate tasks, manage systems, and perform administrative tasks efficiently. Built on the .NET framework, **PowerShell** is both a **_command-line tool_** and a **_scripting environment_**, making it a versatile tool for programmers and system administrators.

> _"PowerShell is great because we had a series of rockstar engineers add their awesomeness to the project."_ ( from the interview with Jeffrey Snover, PowerShell Inventor)

## Why Learn PowerShell?

PowerShell is an essential tool for:

1. Automating repetitive tasks.
2. Managing and configuring systems.
3. Working with files, processes, and services.
4. Interacting with APIs and web services.
5. Writing scripts to solve complex problems.

## PowerShell Features and Terms

- **Cmdlets**: Lightweight commands that perform specific functions.
- **Scripting**: Write and execute scripts, series of commands, to automate tasks.
- **Pipeline**: Chain commands together to pass data between them using |.
- **Remote** Management: Execute commands on remote systems.
- **Modules**: Extend functionality with additional cmdlets and scripts.
- **Extensibility**: Create custom functions, modules, and scripts.
- **Cross-Platform**: PowerShell Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## PowerShell for Beginners

### Basic Commands to Get Started

`Get-Command`: Lists all available commands.

- `Get-Help`: Provides help information for commands.

### Example Script

Here’s a simple script to list all files in a directory and display their sizes:

# Get all files in the current directory

```
$files = Get-ChildItem

# Display file names and sizes

foreach ($file in $files) {
Write-Output "$($file.Name) - $($file.Length) bytes"
}
```
